# Data Structures Practice in JavaScript 

This repo contains a bunch of different CS concepts that I want to explore in JavaScript. I know there are a lot of resources out there to help learn algorithms and data structures, but most of that code is in C, C++, Java, or Python. 

Not that I have anything against those languages, but there ought to be a collection of resources for people trying to learn some of this stuff using JavaScript to write examples. After all, if the conceptual understandings are important, then the use of JavaScript as the language shouldn't matter. 

At the same time, I'm trying to write these examples using ES6/2015 syntax and features.
